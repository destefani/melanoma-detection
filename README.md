# Deep Learning for Melanoma Diagnosis
 
This repository has the objective of assessing the possibility of using Deep Learning based techniques to detect melanomas from a skin lesion picture. Reliably and accurately.
 
## Deliverables
- Model: A model that diagnoses skin lesion images.
- Evaluation: A rigorous statistical analysis of the performance of the model.
- API: An API that serves the model compliently.
- App: A web app that allows users to upload a picture and receive a prediction.
 
## Web Application
- Application: https://share.streamlit.io/destefani/melanoma-app/main/app.py
- Repository: https://github.com/destefani/melanoma-app

## Reproducibility
Reproducibility is one of the pilars of the project. Specially in the medical area, transparency and trust in machine learning models is very important. The development of our research is done with a strong focus on the MONAI library. 
The main reasons for this desition are:
- Reproducibility
- High quality software
- Is built on top of the PyTorch library
- It is backed by a large community of world-class researches, inluding NVIDIA
