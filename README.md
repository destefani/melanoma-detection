# Deep Learning for Melanoma Diagnosis
 
This repository has the objective of assessing the possibility of using Deep Learning based techniques to detect melanomas from a skin lesion picture. Reliably and accurately.
 
## Deliverables
- Model: A model that diagnoses skin lesion images.
- Evaluation: A rigorous statistical analysis of the performance of the model.
- API: An API that serves the model compliently.
- App: A web app that allows users to upload a picture and receive a prediction.
